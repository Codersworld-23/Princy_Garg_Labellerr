# Image Segmentation & Object Tracking â€“ Internship Assignment

This project is an end-to-end pipeline for **image segmentation and object tracking** using **YOLOv8-Seg, ByteTrack, and Labellerr**.  
It was built as part of the AI Software Engineer â€“ PEC internship assignment.

## ðŸ“Œ Workflow
1. **Data Collection** â€“ ~200 images (vehicles & pedestrians).  
2. **Annotation** â€“ 100 images annotated with polygon masks using **Labellerr**.  
3. **Model Training** â€“ YOLOv8n-Seg trained for 100 epochs on Google Colab.  
4. **Evaluation** â€“ IoU, mAP, PR curve, and confusion matrix reported.  
5. **Inference** â€“ Predictions generated on a separate test set.  
6. **Labellerr Integration** â€“ Test set predictions uploaded as pre-annotations.  
7. **Video Tracking** â€“ YOLOv8-Seg integrated with ByteTrack; results exported to `results.json`.

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Confusion matrix and PR curve available in `results/` folder.

## ðŸŽ¥ Demo
- A simple web app accepts a video, runs YOLOv8-Seg + ByteTrack, and exports tracking results in JSON format.  
- **Live demo link:** [to be added]
